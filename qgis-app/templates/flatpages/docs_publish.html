  <h4>How to add your plugin to this repository</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You will need an
      <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid">OSGEO ID</a>&nbsp; to publish
      a plugin
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to <a title="Repo" href="/plugins/">QGIS plugin repo</a> and click on
      <a title="Share" href="/plugins/add/">Share a plugin</a>.
    </li>
    <li>For a prompt approval of the plugin read the following guidelines</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Requirements</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Plugins need to have at least minimal documentation</li>
    <li>
      The plugin metadata contains a valid link to the homepage, the repository
      (source code), the tracker (issue tracker) and a license
    </li>
    <li>
      The plugin license is compatible with the
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"
        >GPLv2 or later</a
      >
      (<a
        href="http://blog.qgis.org/2016/05/29/licensing-requirements-for-qgis-plugins/"
        >more information about licensing</a
      >)
    </li>
    <li>
      Respect the licenses by libraries and other resources that your plugin
      uses
    </li>
    <li>
      If the plugin has an external dependency, this needs to be clearly stated
      in the About metadata field; you can include a short guide to install
      Python libs as needed, or opint to existing guides, e.g. for Windows:
      "<a href="https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/installing-python-packages-in-qgis-3-for-windows/"
         >Installing Python packages in QGIS 3 (for Windows)</a>"
    </li>
    <li>Don't include binaries</li>
    <li>The size of the plugin package should not exceed 20MB</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Recommendations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Write comments in your code in English, it will make it easier for others
      to contribute
    </li>
    <li>Provide a minimal data set for testing</li>
    <li>
      Put the plugin into the appropriate menu (Vector, Raster, Web, Database)
    </li>
    <li>
      Before publishing a new plugin, check if it duplicates existing
      functionality and explore collaboration possibilities
    </li>
    <li>
      Make your plugin work on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOs)
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't rename the plugin title just because it's upgraded to a newer
      version like QGIS 3
    </li>
    <li>
      Check if source code uploaded to the QGIS plugin repo as zip is identical
      to "Code repository" indicated in metadata.txt
    </li>
    <li>
      Mention any requirements, dependencies and restrictions in the description
      text section (which can be multi-line). Examples of requirements,
      dependencies and restrictions are, if the plugin is running only on
      selected platforms, requires SW to be installed separately or some user
      account, but also if the plugin is spatially covering just some countries
      or regions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Tips and Tricks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keep your source repository in good shape:&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>
          No generated files left in the repository (ui_*.py, resources_rc.py,
          gen. help filesâ€¦).
        </li>
        <li>No __MACOSX, .git, __pycache__ or other hidden directories</li>
        <li>Good code organization (subfolders).</li>
        <li>Code comments are available.</li>
        <li>PEP8 &amp; Python/QGIS guidelines compliance.</li>
        <li>A README file and a LICENSE file are present.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If some dependencies are not available in OSGeo4w Python, provide
      instructions on how to install them on Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name of the plugin and the folder name do not repeat the word
      `plugin`.
    </li>
    <li>
      Plugins should make use of QgsNetworkAccessManager instead of using
      urllib2/requests/etc... which often fail to use correct proxy settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      The
      <a title="Plugin builder" href="/plugins/pluginbuilder3/"
        >plugin builder</a
      >
      plugin is recommended, especially for new users.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Plugin approval process</h4>
  <p>
    The approval of plugins is primarily carried out by contributors. Currently,
    the primary contributor is Admire Nyakudya (<a href="mailto:addloe@gmail.com">addloe@gmail.com</a>). Do not
    hesitate to get in touch with him if you have any questions about the plugin
    approval process.
  </p>
  <p>The approval process involves the following steps.</p>
  <h5>New Plugins</h5>
  <p>All new plugins follow the rough guidelines outlined below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Plugin metadata.txt should be properly populated with working links i.e.:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Plugin home page - This link should direct users to a page on a
          website that describes the plugin functionality. If you do not have a
          dedicated page on your website that describes plugin usage, please use
          the README in the repository or use the code repository as the link.
          Any other links will result in the plugin being rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tracker - This should link to the issue tracker in your code
          repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code repository - This should link to the code repository. It is
          expected that the code in the repository is accessible and not a zip
          file. The repository should also be publicly accessible. Plugins that
          utilize binaries will not be approved. If you feel that there is no
          way to provide your plugin without binaries, please reach out to the
          QGIS Developers mailing list to motivate your case or the QGIS PSC for
          further discussions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Plugins cover a whole range of domains which the person doing the
    approval might not be versed with. With such an expectation, we will try to
    do random tests (random plugins will be selected) to see if the plugin
    installs and runs without crashing QGIS. We also expect plugins to be
    cross-platform, working on Unix systems and Windows. In the list of
    published plugins, we have a diverse range of plugins offering different
    functionality. We encourage plugin developers to collaborate on plugins
    offering the same functionality as developing plugins with functionality
    that is almost similar. If you need to enhance a particular plugin, we are
    able to facilitate this with an existing author. For issues relating to the
    transfer of ownership, or updating any other metadata about existing
    plugins, please do not hesitate to contact us through the QGIS Developer
    mailing lists.
  </p>
  <h5>Existing Plugins (New updates)</h5>
  <p>
    These are plugins that are already in use and being enhanced by new versions
    being uploaded. During the approval process, we expect the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Properly update metadata to include a changelog. This will be beneficial
      for users to understand what has changed between versions.
    </li>
    <li>Properly annotate versions with new version numbers.</li>
    <li>
      We will also check the metadata.txt links i.e. plugin homepage, tracker,
      etc. to see if they are still working.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Testing will also be done randomly to see if the plugin still works
    and does not crash QGIS.
  </p>
  <p>
    We try to publish/approve plugins daily with the exception of weekends. If
    you have uploaded a plugin on Friday-Sunday, it will most likely be approved
    on Monday. During extended holiday periods, the timelines might be even
    longer. We also take into consideration that contributors live in different
    parts of the world with different public holidays. This might also impact
    the timelines for approval.
